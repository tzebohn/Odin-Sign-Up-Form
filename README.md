#Purpose
This project was created as a hands-on learning experience. Rather than focusing on frameworks or complexity, the emphasis is on understanding the fundamentals of front-end development and version control.

The primary goal of this project is to explore and practice the following front-end development concepts:
Working with SVGs and vector graphics.
Building and validating HTML forms.
Styling with CSS, including layout and design elements.
Using DOM manipulation in JavaScript for interactivity.
Developing good habits with Git and GitHub commits.
